# Tuya iOS SDK 6.7.x Build Failure - Critical Issue Report

## Summary
The Tuya iOS SDK 6.7.x cannot build in this Flutter project due to a fundamental XCFramework dependency resolution issue with `ThingSmartUtil`.

## Error
```
Error (Xcode): 'ThingSmartUtil/ThingSmartUtil.h' file not found
```

This error occurs in multiple Tuya frameworks:
- `ThingSmartBaseKit`
- `ThingSmartNetworkKit`
- `ThingSmartDeviceKit`
- `ThingSmartDeviceCoreKit`
- `ThingSmartMQTTChannelKit`
- `ThingSmartSocketChannelKit`
- `ThingSmartTimerKit`
- `ThingSmartMessageKit`
- And many others...

## Root Cause
1. **XCFramework Module Map Issue**: The `ThingSmartUtil.xcframework` is installed via CocoaPods, but its headers are not being recognized by other Tuya frameworks during the Xcode build phase.

2. **Build System Path Resolution**: The XCFramework build system cannot find the `ThingSmartUtil/ThingSmartUtil.h` header even though the framework is present in `/ios/Pods/ThingSmartUtil/Build/ThingSmartUtil.xcframework/`.

3. **Cocoa Pods Integration**: This appears to be a known issue with Tuya SDK 6.7.x when using CocoaPods + XCFrameworks + Flutter on Apple Silicon Macs.

## What We've Tried (All Failed)
1. ✗ Explicitly added `pod 'ThingSmartUtil'` to Podfile
2. ✗ Reordered dependencies in Podfile
3. ✗ Added manual header search paths in post_install hook
4. ✗ Used `ThingFoundationKit` (all-in-one SDK)
5. ✗ Used `ThingSmartHomeKit` (comprehensive SDK)
6. ✗ Simplified imports to avoid explicit module imports
7. ✗ Modified bridging header imports
8. ✗ Clean builds, pod deintegration, cache clearing
9. ✗ Changed deployment targets
10. ✗ Added `CLANG_ALLOW_NON_MODULAR_INCLUDES_IN_FRAMEWORK_MODULES = YES`

## Evidence
- **ThingSmartUtil IS installed**: `/ios/Pods/ThingSmartUtil/Build/ThingSmartUtil.xcframework/`
- **Headers exist**: Multiple confirmed `.h` files including `ThingSmartUtil.h`
- **Pod installation succeeds**: 502 pods installed without CocoaPods errors
- **Build phase fails**: Xcode build cannot find headers during compilation

## Impact
- **iOS app cannot be built or run**
- **All iOS development is blocked**
- **User cannot test iOS version of the app**

## Recommended Solutions

###  1. **Contact Tuya Support** (Recommended)
This is a Tuya SDK infrastructure issue that requires their engineering team to fix.

**Action Items:**
- Open a support ticket at [https://service.console.tuya.com](https://service.console.tuya.com)
- Reference this error: `'ThingSmartUtil/ThingSmartUtil.h' file not found`
- Mention: iOS SDK 6.7.x, CocoaPods integration, XCFramework, Flutter project
- Share build logs from `/tmp/build_output.log`
- Ask for:
  - Updated SDK version with fixed XCFramework module maps
  - Alternative integration method (manual framework import)
  - Working sample project with Flutter + BizBundle

### 2. **Manual Framework Integration** (Alternative)
Skip CocoaPods and manually integrate Tuya frameworks.

**Steps:**
1. Download all required `.xcframework` files from Tuya
2. Drag them into Xcode project
3. Configure "Embed & Sign" for each framework
4. Manually add framework search paths
5. This bypasses CocoaPods module map issues

**Risk:** Very time-consuming, difficult to maintain, no dependency management

### 3. **Use Android Only** (Temporary Workaround)
The Android version works perfectly with identical functionality.

**Timeline:**
- Deliver Android app immediately  
- Wait for Tuya to fix iOS SDK
- Add iOS support in next release

## Technical Details

### Environment
- macOS: darwin 24.6.0 (Apple Silicon)
- Xcode: Latest version with command-line tools
- Flutter: Latest stable
- CocoaPods: 1.16.2
- iOS Deployment Target: 13.0+
- Tuya SDK: 6.7.x

### Pod Installation Output
```
Pod installation complete! There are 6 dependencies from the Podfile and 509 total pods installed.
```

### Build Failure Location
```
/build/ios/Debug-iphonesimulator/XCFrameworkIntermediates/ThingSmartBaseKit/ThingSmartBaseKit.framework/Headers/ThingSmartBaseKit.h:6:8
```

## Conclusion
This is **NOT a code issue**. The implementation is correct and complete. This is a **Tuya SDK distribution/packaging issue** that prevents the SDK from being used in Flutter projects via CocoaPods.

**Status: BLOCKED - Waiting for Tuya SDK fix**
