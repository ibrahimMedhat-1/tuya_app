# Quick Start Guide - iOS Testing

## Prerequisites ‚úÖ
- [x] iOS implementation updated to match Android
- [x] CocoaPods dependencies installed
- [x] Tuya BizBundle configured
- [x] Bluetooth support added

## Step 1: Build the iOS App

### Option A: Using Xcode
```bash
cd /Users/rebuy/Desktop/Coding\ projects/ZeroTech-Flutter-IB2
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```
Then press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run in Xcode

### Option B: Using Flutter CLI
```bash
cd /Users/rebuy/Desktop/Coding\ projects/ZeroTech-Flutter-IB2

# List available iOS devices/simulators
flutter devices

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Or just run on first available iOS device
flutter run
```

## Step 2: Test Login

1. Launch the app
2. Enter your Tuya account credentials:
   - Email: (your Tuya account email)
   - Password: (your Tuya account password)
3. Tap "Login"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Login success message
- ‚úÖ Navigate to home screen
- ‚úÖ See list of homes

**Debugging:**
- Check Xcode console for logs starting with `üîê [iOS]`
- Should see: "‚úÖ [iOS] User logged in successfully"

## Step 3: View Devices

1. After login, you should see your homes
2. App automatically loads devices for first home
3. Each device shows:
   - Device name
   - Online/offline status
   - Device icon

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ List of all devices in home
- ‚úÖ Correct online/offline status
- ‚úÖ Device icons displayed

**Debugging:**
- Check Xcode console for logs starting with `üì± [iOS]`
- Should see: "‚úÖ [iOS] Found X devices for home Y"

## Step 4: Test Device Pairing

1. Tap "Add Device" button (+ icon or "Pair Devices")
2. Native Tuya category selection screen should appear
3. Select a device category (e.g., "Lighting")
4. Select device type (e.g., "Light")
5. Put your device in pairing mode
6. Follow on-screen instructions

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Native Tuya UI appears (NOT Flutter UI)
- ‚úÖ Can select device categories
- ‚úÖ Pairing instructions shown
- ‚úÖ Device successfully paired
- ‚úÖ Device appears in device list

**Debugging:**
- Check Xcode console for: "‚úÖ [iOS] ThingActivatorProtocol service found"
- Should see: "üì± [iOS] Device pairing UI started successfully"
- If error "SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE", check ThingSmartBusinessExtensionConfig setup

## Step 5: Test Device Control

1. Tap on any device in the list
2. Native Tuya control panel should appear
3. Try controlling the device (toggle switch, adjust brightness, etc.)
4. Changes should reflect on physical device

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Native Tuya control panel appears (React Native UI)
- ‚úÖ Can control device (toggle, slider, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Physical device responds
- ‚úÖ Status updates in real-time

**Debugging:**
- Check Xcode console for: "‚úÖ [iOS] ThingPanelProtocol service found"
- Should see: "‚úÖ [iOS] Device control panel opened successfully"
- If panel doesn't open, verify device exists and user is logged in

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "ThingActivatorProtocol service not available"
**Cause:** BizBundle not properly initialized

**Solution:**
```swift
// Verify in AppDelegate.swift:
ThingSmartBusinessExtensionConfig.setupConfig()
```

### Issue 2: Device pairing shows empty list
**Cause:** Device not in pairing mode or wrong network

**Solutions:**
1. Put device in pairing mode (LED blinking rapidly)
2. Ensure iPhone connected to 2.4GHz WiFi (not 5GHz)
3. Grant location permissions (required for WiFi scanning)
4. Grant Bluetooth permissions (for BLE devices)

### Issue 3: Device control panel shows blank screen
**Cause:** Device not found or network issue

**Solutions:**
1. Verify deviceId is correct
2. Check device is online in device list
3. Ensure stable internet connection
4. Try refreshing device list

### Issue 4: Build fails with "Pod not found"
**Cause:** CocoaPods not installed or out of date

**Solution:**
```bash
cd ios
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter run
```

## Permissions Required

### iOS Info.plist
The following permissions should be in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<!-- Location (required for WiFi device pairing) -->
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location access is required to configure WiFi devices</string>

<!-- Bluetooth (required for BLE device pairing) -->
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Bluetooth access is required to configure BLE devices</string>

<!-- Local Network (required for device discovery) -->
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Local network access is required to discover and control devices</string>

<!-- Camera (optional - for QR code scanning) -->
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Camera access is required to scan device QR codes</string>
```

## Verification Checklist

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] User can log in with email/password

Check app size after build:
```bash
# Build release version
flutter build ios --release

# Check .app size
du -sh build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app
```
Expected: ~100-150MB (includes BizBundle)

### Runtime Performance
- Device list loads in < 2 seconds
- Device pairing UI opens instantly
- Control panel opens in < 1 second
- Device commands execute in < 500ms

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Everything Works ‚úÖ
1. Test on physical iOS device (not just simulator)
2. Test with multiple device types
3. Test with multiple homes
4. Prepare for production release

### If Issues Found ‚ùå
1. Check Xcode console for error logs
2. Review iOS_Integration_Complete.md for troubleshooting
3. Compare with working sample project
4. Contact Tuya support if SDK issue

## Log Monitoring

### Xcode Console
Watch for these log prefixes:
- `üöÄ [iOS]` - App lifecycle events
- `üîß [iOS]` - SDK initialization
- `‚úÖ [iOS]` - Success messages
- `‚ùå [iOS]` - Error messages
- `üì± [iOS]` - Device operations
- `üîê [iOS]` - Authentication
- `üè† [iOS]` - Home operations
- `üéÆ [iOS]` - Control panel operations

### Flutter Logs
```bash
flutter logs
```

## Success Criteria

Your iOS implementation is working correctly if:
1. ‚úÖ All 7 method calls work (login, logout, isLoggedIn, getHomes, getHomeDevices, pairDevices, openDeviceControlPanel)
2. ‚úÖ Native Tuya UI appears for pairing and control
3. ‚úÖ Data formats match Android exactly
4. ‚úÖ Physical devices respond to commands
5. ‚úÖ No crashes or errors in console
