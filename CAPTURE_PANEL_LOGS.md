# Capturing Full Panel Launch Logs

## Critical Finding

**iOS Works:** Panel is PUSHED onto UINavigationController stack  
**Android Fails:** Panel launches as separate Activity with no navigation context

This causes React Native to fail initialization on Android.

## Next Step: Capture Full Logs

I've cleared the logcat. Now:

1. **Run this command in a new terminal:**
```bash
cd "/Users/rebuy/Desktop/Coding projects/ZeroTech-Flutter-IB2"
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat > panel_full_logs.txt
```

2. **Tap any device** (wait 10 seconds)

3. **Stop the log** (Ctrl+C)

4. **Search the log file for errors:**
```bash
grep -iE "(error|exception|failed|ReactNative|WebView|Bundle)" panel_full_logs.txt
```

This will show us:
- React Native initialization errors
- WebView failures  
- Bundle download issues
- Why the panel Activity becomes invisible

## Alternative: Try Android Fragment Instead of Activity

Based on iOS success, we should try embedding the panel as a Fragment in MainActivity instead of launching a separate Activity.

**Would you like me to:**
1. First analyze the full logs (run command above), OR
2. Immediately try the Fragment approach (more complex)

Choose option 1 if you want to understand what's failing first.
